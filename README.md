# MITx Projects
 Projects for MITx classes

**Project 0 -** Installation of relevant packages, intro to numpy, pandas, pytorch, etc.

**Project 1 -** Sentiment analysis and classification for Amazon reviews. Built perceptron and pegasos algorithms from scratch.

**Project 2 -** Part 1 of MNIST digit recognition. Built linear regression, SVM, and softmax tools from scratch.
